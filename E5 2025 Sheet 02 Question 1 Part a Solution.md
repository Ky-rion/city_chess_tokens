Hello there! This is a fantastic question and one of the most famous and powerful real-world proofs of Einstein's special relativity. I'm happy to walk you through it.

The core of the problem is a paradox: how can a particle with a lifetime of only 2.19 microseconds (millionths of a second) travel 10 kilometers?

Let's break it down.

### 1. The "Classical" Problem (Why it _seems_ impossible)

First, let's ignore relativity and see what classical physics would predict.

-   **Muon's Lifetime ($T$):** $2.19 \times 10^{-6} \text{ s}$
    
-   **Muon's Speed ($v$):** The problem gives $\beta = 0.9997$. This means the speed $v$ is $0.9997$ times the speed of light ($c$).
    
    -   $v = \beta c = 0.9997 \times (3.0 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}) \approx 2.9991 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$
        

Now, let's calculate the **maximum distance** this muon could possibly travel in its lifetime, according to classical mechanics:

-   $\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}$
    
-   $\text{Distance} = (2.9991 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}) \times (2.19 \times 10^{-6} \text{ s})$
    
-   $\text{Distance} \approx 656.8 \text{ meters}$ (or $0.657 \text{ km}$)
    

According to classical physics, this muon should decay after traveling only about 657 meters. It needs to travel **10,000 meters** ($10 \text{ km}$) to reach the ground. Therefore, it seems impossible for us to ever detect it.

And yet... we _do_ detect them, in large numbers! This is where relativity comes in.

### 2. The Relativistic Solution (Time Dilation)

The key is that **time itself is relative**. The 2.19 $\mu$s lifetime is the **proper time** (which we call $\tau$, or 'tau').

> **Proper Time ($\tau$):** This is the time measured by an observer in the _same reference frame_ as the event. Think of it as the time measured by a tiny clock strapped to the muon's wrist. For the muon, it _only_ lives for $2.19 \mu$s.

But we are not in the muon's frame. We are in the "lab frame" (Earth's surface), watching the muon speed towards us. The problem gives us the relationship:

$d\tau = dt / \gamma$

Let's rearrange this to be more intuitive:

$dt = \gamma d\tau$

-   $dt$ is the time interval we measure in the **lab frame** (Earth).
    
-   $d\tau$ is the **proper time** interval (the muon's $2.19 \mu$s lifetime).
    
-   $\gamma$ (gamma) is the **Lorentz factor**, which tells us _how much_ time is "dilated" or stretched.
    

This effect is called **time dilation**. From our perspective, the moving muon's internal "clock" is running **slow**. So, while the muon "feels" its life is $2.19 \mu$s long, _we_ will observe it lasting much longer.

Let's justify the answer by calculating exactly how long it lives in our frame and how long it needs.

### 3. The Calculation and Justification

**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\gamma$)**

The formula for $\gamma$ is given right in your text:

$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}$

We are given $\beta = 0.9997$:

-   $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.9997)^2}}$
    
-   $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.99940009}}$
    
-   $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.00059991}}$
    
-   $\gamma \approx \frac{1}{0.02449}$
    
-   **$\gamma \approx 40.83$**
    

This is a crucial number! It means that from our perspective, time for the muon is slowed down by a factor of about 41.

**Step 2: Calculate the Muon's Lifetime in _Our_ Frame (Lab Frame)**

We use the time dilation formula:

-   $T_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \times T_{\text{proper}}$
    
-   $T_{\text{lab}} = (40.83) \times (2.19 \times 10^{-6} \text{ s})$
    
-   **$T_{\text{lab}} \approx 89.42 \times 10^{-6} \text{ s}$** (or $89.42 \mu$s)
    

So, from our spot on Earth, we don't see the muon live for 2.2 $\mu$s. We see it live for over **89 $\mu$s**!

**Step 3: Calculate the Time _Needed_ for the Muon to Reach Earth**

Now we do a simple "Distance / Speed" calculation, all from our lab frame.

-   $\text{Distance } (h) = 10 \text{ km} = 10,000 \text{ m}$
    
-   $\text{Speed } (v) = 0.9997 \times c = 2.9991 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$
    
-   $t_{\text{travel}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}$
    
-   $t_{\text{travel}} = \frac{10,000 \text{ m}}{2.9991 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}}$
    
-   **$t_{\text{travel}} \approx 33.34 \times 10^{-6} \text{ s}$** (or $33.34 \mu$s)
    

**Step 4: The Conclusion**

Now we compare the two times we calculated in our lab frame:

-   **Time the muon _lives_ (from our view):** $T_{\text{lab}} \approx 89.42 \mu$s
    
-   **Time the muon _needs_ to travel (from our view):** $t_{\text{travel}} \approx 33.34 \mu$s
    

Since the muon's observed lifetime ($89.42 \mu$s) is **much longer** than the time it needs to make the journey ($33.34 \mu$s), it survives the trip with plenty of time to spare.

### **Final Answer**

**Yes, we can absolutely observe these muons on the surface of the earth.**

**Justification:** According to classical physics, the muon (with a lifetime of $2.19 \mu$s) would decay after traveling only $\approx 657$ meters, making it impossible to reach the 10,000-meter-deep atmosphere.

However, due to **special relativity**, we observe **time dilation**. The muon's high velocity ($\beta = 0.9997$) results in a large Lorentz factor ($\gamma \approx 40.83$). This means we observe the muon's internal clock running $\approx 41$ times slower.

-   Its lifetime, as measured by us in the lab frame, is dilated from $2.19 \mu$s to **$T_{\text{lab}} = \gamma T_{\text{proper}} \approx 89.42 \mu$s**.
    
-   The time it needs to travel 10 km to the surface is **$t_{\text{travel}} = h/v \approx 33.34 \mu$s**.
    

Because the muon's observed lifetime ($89.42 \mu$s) is significantly greater than its required travel time ($33.34 \mu$s), it easily survives the journey to be detected on the ground. This phenomenon is one of the key experimental confirmations of special relativity.

This is a cornerstone of particle physics! Does it make sense how time dilation solves the paradox? We can move on to your next question whenever you're ready.
