Hello! This is a wonderful question. It's the most modern and profound part of the problem, and it's exactly what real-world experiments (like the **KATRIN experiment** in Germany) are doing _right now_.

If the electron neutrino has a mass ($m_\nu > 0$), the $\beta$ limit energy $E_0$ will **decrease**.

Here is the detailed breakdown of why.

### 1. 💰 The "Energy Budget" Revisited: Mass as a Cost

Think back to our "energy budget," the Q-value.

$Q \approx 18.6 \text{ keV}$

This is the **total, fixed amount of energy** we get to spend in this decay. This energy comes from the initial mass difference between $³\text{H}$ and ($³\text{He} + e^-$) and is locked in.

In part (b), we assumed the neutrino was **massless** ($m_\nu = 0$). This meant that creating the neutrino had _no_ minimum energy cost. It was "free" to create, so in our $E_0$ scenario, we could assume it was created with $K_{\bar{\nu}_e} = 0$ and $E_{\text{total},\nu} = 0$.

But now, we have $m_\nu > 0$.

Thanks to Einstein's $E = mc^2$, we have a new rule: to create a particle _with mass_, we must pay a "creation tax." This is the particle's **rest mass energy**.

-   **Total Neutrino Energy** = (Its kinetic energy) + (Its rest mass energy)
    
-   $E_{\text{total},\nu} = K_{\bar{\nu}_e} + m_\nu c^2$
    

This rest mass energy, $m_\nu c^2$, is a new, _mandatory_ expense that must be paid out of our $Q$ budget _every single time_ the decay happens.

### 2. 🧮 The New Calculation for $E_0$

Let's write out our full, new energy conservation equation:

$$Q = K_{e^-} + K_{³\text{He}} + E_{\text{total},\nu}$$

$$Q = K_{e^-} + K_{³\text{He}} + K_{\bar{\nu}_e} + m_\nu c^2$$

Now, let's find the $\beta$ limit energy ($E_0$) again. $E_0$ is the **maximum possible kinetic energy of the electron** ($K_{e^-}$).

To make $K_{e^-}$ as large as possible, we must make _all the other energies_ as _small_ as possible.

-   What's the minimum $K_{³\text{He}}$? **Zero**.
    
-   What's the minimum $K_{\bar{\nu}_e}$? **Zero**.
    

Let's plug these minimums into our budget to find the maximum $K_{e^-}$ (which is $E_0$):

$$Q = (K_{e^-} = E_0) + (K_{³\text{He}} = 0) + (K_{\bar{\nu}_e} = 0) + m_\nu c^2$$

This simplifies to:

$Q = E_0 + m_\nu c^2$

### 3. ✅ The Final Answer

By rearranging that simple formula, we get our new $\beta$ limit energy:

**$E_0 = Q - m_\nu c^2$**

Let's compare this to our answer from part (b):

-   Case 1 (Massless Neutrino, part b):
    
    $m_\nu = 0$
    
    $E_0 = Q - 0 = Q \approx \textbf{18.6 keV}$
    
-   Case 2 (Massive Neutrino, part c):
    
    $m_\nu > 0$
    
    $E_0 = Q - m_\nu c^2 \approx \textbf{18.6 keV} - (\text{the neutrino's mass energy})$
    

This shows us _exactly_ how $E_0$ changes: **The $\beta$ limit energy is reduced by the exact amount of the neutrino's rest mass energy.**

This is precisely what the "Note" in your problem is talking about. Scientists can't "catch" the neutrino to weigh it. Instead, they _very_ precisely measure the maximum energy of the electrons ($E_0$) from tritium decay.

They look for the "endpoint" of the electron's energy spectrum.

-   If the endpoint is exactly at $Q$, the neutrino is massless.
    
-   If the endpoint is _just slightly before_ $Q$, that "missing" energy _is_ the neutrino's mass.
    

The note says the current upper limit is $m_\nu < 2.2 \text{ eV}/c^2$. This means that in experiments, the _most_ the endpoint has ever been seen to be "short" is $2.2 \text{ eV}$. This is an incredibly tiny number (compare $2.2 \text{ eV}$ to $18,600 \text{ keV}$!), which shows just how light the neutrino is, and what an amazing experimental challenge this is.

This concludes our three-part exploration of tritium decay! We've gone from basic stability (part a) to conservation laws (part b) and all the way to the cutting-edge hunt for the neutrino mass (part c).
