This is an excellent, very insightful question! It gets right to the heart of scientific modeling.

You've stumbled upon one of the most important limitations of the Bethe-Weizsäcker mass formula. It points to a deeper, more subtle piece of physics that our "liquid drop" model completely misses.

Let's break this down.

### 1. What Our Formula Predicts

First, let's look at what our formula from part (d) told us.

-   For ${}^{48}_{21}\text{Sc}$ ($Z=21$, $N=27$), we calculated $\frac{B}{A} \approx \mathbf{8.718 \text{ MeV}}$.
    
-   For ${}^{48}_{20}\text{Ca}$ ($Z=20$, $N=28$), we calculated $\frac{B}{A} \approx \mathbf{8.670 \text{ MeV}}$.
    

According to the Semi-Empirical Mass Formula (SEMF), the binding energy per nucleon of Scandium-48 is _higher_ than that of Calcium-48. This means our formula predicts that **${}^{48}\text{Sc}$ is more stable than ${}^{48}\text{Ca}$**.

### 2. What Reality Shows

As your question correctly states, the exact opposite is true:

-   **${}^{48}\text{Ca}$ is stable.** In fact, it's _extremely_ long-lived (its half-life is so long it's considered observationally stable).
    
-   **${}^{48}\text{Sc}$ is not stable.** It's radioactive and decays (with a half-life of about 44 hours) into ${}^{48}\text{Ti}$ (Titanium-48), which _is_ stable.
    

This is a major failure of our model! The model's prediction is not just slightly off; it's completely backward.

### 3. The "Missing Physics": The Nuclear Shell Model

So, why does our formula fail so spectacularly here?

The answer is that the Weizsäcker formula is based on the **Liquid Drop Model**, which treats the nucleus like a uniform, classical blob of "nuclear fluid." It's missing a key quantum mechanical effect that is analogous to electron shells in an atom.

This missing piece is described by the **Nuclear Shell Model**.

#### ⚛️ Analogy: Noble Gases in Chemistry

Think about electrons in an atom. We know that atoms are exceptionally stable and non-reactive when their electron shells are completely filled. This is what makes **Noble Gases** (Helium, Neon, Argon, etc.) so special. An atom with one extra electron (like Sodium, ${}_{11}\text{Na}$) or one missing electron (like Fluorine, ${}_9\text{F}$) is _much_ less stable and highly reactive.

#### ☢️ "Magic Numbers" in Nuclear Physics

It turns out the _exact same thing_ happens inside the nucleus. Protons and neutrons (independently) fill up their own quantum energy shells. A nucleus where either the proton or neutron shells are _completely full_ is **exceptionally stable**—far more stable than the smooth liquid-drop model would predict.

The numbers of nucleons that correspond to these full shells are called Magic Numbers:

2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126

Now, let's look at our two nuclei again with this new information:

### 4. Explaining the Behavior

**1. ${}^{48}_{20}\text{Ca}$ (Calcium-48)**

-   **Proton Number:** $Z = 20$. This is a **magic number**!
    
-   **Neutron Number:** $N = A - Z = 48 - 20 = 28$. This is _also_ a **magic number**!
    

Calcium-48 is a **"doubly magic"** nucleus. It is the nuclear equivalent of a "super" noble gas. It has perfectly closed shells for _both_ protons and neutrons. This configuration gives it an enormous, extra boost in binding energy and stability that our Weizsäcker formula cannot account for.

**2. ${}^{48}_{21}\text{Sc}$ (Scandium-48)**

-   **Proton Number:** $Z = 21$. This is $20 + 1$. It has one "extra" proton living _outside_ the stable, closed $Z=20$ shell.
    
-   **Neutron Number:** $N = A - Z = 48 - 21 = 27$. This is $28 - 1$. It has a "hole"—it is one neutron _short_ of filling the stable $N=28$ shell.
    

This nucleus is the worst of both worlds. It's an odd-odd nucleus (which our formula _does_ penalize), but more importantly, it's _not_ magic. It has a loosely bound extra proton and an incomplete neutron shell, making it far less stable than the "doubly magic" ${}^{48}\text{Ca}$.

### 🏁 The Final Conclusion

The Weizsäcker formula only sees the "big picture" trends. It correctly identified that $Z=21$ or $Z=22$ is the _general_ area of stability for $A=48$.

However, it is blind to the **profound quantum mechanical stability** of the closed nuclear shells. The "magic" of $Z=20$ and $N=28$ gives ${}^{48}\text{Ca}$ a massive, extra stability that completely overwhelms the smooth trend described by our formula, making it the stable isobar instead of ${}^{48}\text{Sc}$.

This discrepancy was, in fact, one of the key pieces of experimental evidence that proved the existence of nuclear shells and led to the development of the Nobel Prize-winning Nuclear Shell Model!

This has been a fantastic set of questions. Is there anything else about the semi-empirical mass formula or nuclear models you'd like to discuss?
