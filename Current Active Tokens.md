# Guide

New tokens are to be added to A only after the General session of the day
This is to prevent repeats between Special and General
All new tokens from a given day are randomised in order
Then, in that order, they are put at the bottom of their estimated fitting pillar
Add tokens to the "All Tokens" list with a date corresponding to when they were added
This serves a similar function to time-marking completed glasses


Update 27.12.2025
During General, Tokens are put into "Completed Tokens" before moving on to the next Token
Before beginning the next General session (different day), these Tokens are evaluated again and put in their estimated fitting pillar
This serves to evaluate how much knowledge stuck from the tokens in the previous session

When making a Token, try to include a link at the end to an exam-relevant important stuff summary

Please also try to get the computer to look at the professor answers to minimise differences in learned and required knowledge

When having a more Gen-focused session, try to include a Glass 9 to test the knowledge at the end

When in a Gen session, try not to spend more than half a glass on each token
Exceptions are for very long tokens but there aren't many of those (mark with AA?)
It doesn't have to be complete perfect, but please try to get as much out of the token in 15 minutes as possible!
Prioritise moving on over breaking the rules. Adjust the work to the rules, not the other way 
The work is generally more flexible

01.01.2026
Current project: be up to date on T4 tokens
So I'll capture as many T4 tokens here as I can
But I should first get an overview of the tokens that I still need
To that end, let's make a checklist
There are currently ten sheets, let's get them all
Now that I have the sheets and answers, let's count problems
And now that I've counted them, let's see which ones I already have
And first, maybe I'll move this list to the bottom of the file
Great, looks like I need 16 tokens, not counting sheet 11 or whatever else might pop up
This will really be a test of how quickly I can capture these guys
Let's do what we can, shall we?
It's funny how much of this I hardly remember
But that will come with time, as it is supposed to
That's the whole point
Actually I've got 14 and I need 16 more, I need more tokens for T4 than I currently have!
What a world
I've got answers up to and including sheet 8, so I'll use those
Maybe even compare a token with answers to a token without answers
But the answers should make it better, by all rights and laws
Perhaps I can get by with just copy-pasting three pieces of information
But I do also have to make the token files
Let's do that now
- [x] Sheet 1
	- [x] Question 1
	- [x] Question 2
- [x] Sheet 2
	- [x] Question 1
	- [x] Question 2
	- [x] Question 3
- [x] Sheet 3
	- [x] Question 1
	- [x] Question 2
	- [x] Question 3
- [x] Sheet 4
	- [x] Question 1
	- [x] Question 2
	- [x] Question 3
- [x] Sheet 5
	- [x] Question 1
	- [x] Question 2
- [x] Sheet 6
	- [x] Question 1
	- [x] Question 2
	- [x] Question 3
	- [x] Question 4
- [x] Sheet 7
	- [x] Question 1
	- [x] Question 2
	- [x] Question 3
- [x] Sheet 8
	- [x] Question 1
	- [x] Question 2
	- [x] Question 3
- [ ] Sheet 9
	- [ ] Question 1
	- [ ] Question 2
	- [ ] Question 3
- [ ] Sheet 10
	- [ ] Question 1
	- [ ] Question 2
	- [ ] Question 3
	- [ ] Question 4
- [ ] Sheet 11? (not out yet)


So, I'll put the new tokens here and sort them later
I really don't want to spend too much time on this
Can I do two tokens in every glass?
Probably, with the right setup
Then let's go as quickly as I can!
Also, it's alright if I don't review the tokens as thoroughly or check for consistency
I'll do a second pass over these tokens when they're all done
I just need to capture them for the strings to close
Also I don't like how much it rewrites itself
It only seems to lose detail when doing so...
But there are ways around this. I'll try it with longer thinking first

Right, here's another thought. It works so well with the prof answers that I don't want to do it without
In other words, I think I'll wait for some more prof answers to come in
And I'll say for the purposes of the string that I'm "up to date" as long as I'm up to date with the answers, not the sheets
Therefore I can try making other strings to be up to date with other subjects on the same day, as soon as I get some fuel
I'll pivot to a different subject for this last token now
E5 sheet 04 question 4? Let's try it
We have E5 solutions up to sheet 5 currently, which is nice


Let's do some statistical physics! You are my theoretical physics professor and I am the curious student who has never seen the material before. Please explain the answer to this question. I have also included the solution from another professor, please explain using his answers. Answer always in English and in lots of good detail. Answer only a) for the moment, we'll get to the other parts of the question later. Thank you!

Now, rewrite your previous response exactly but remove every single citation, bracketed number, and grounding tag. Provide only the clean text so I can copy-paste it elsewhere.

Here is the next part of the question, please also answer this one in lots of good detail. Thank you!

Thank you for the explanation! Could you make a little summary of important formulas and concepts from this question, something that I could write on a cheat sheet in case this comes up in an exam? Thank you!
