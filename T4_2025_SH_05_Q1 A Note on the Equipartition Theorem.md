The internal energy formula for a monatomic ideal gas, $U = \frac{3}{2}PV$, is derived from the kinetic theory of gases. Here is the breakdown of where it comes from:

### 1. Kinetic Energy of a Single Atom

In a monatomic gas (like Helium or Argon), atoms are treated as point particles moving freely in 3D space. Each atom has three degrees of freedom corresponding to motion in the x, y, and z directions.

According to the **Equipartition Theorem**, each degree of freedom contributes $\frac{1}{2}k_B T$ to the average energy, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is temperature.

Since there are 3 degrees of freedom (x, y, z translational motion):

$$\text{Average Energy per atom} = 3 \times \frac{1}{2}k_B T = \frac{3}{2}k_B T$$

### 2. Scaling Up to the Whole Gas

If you have $N$ atoms in your container, the total internal energy $U$ is just the sum of the energies of all individual atoms:

$$U = N \times \left( \frac{3}{2}k_B T \right) = \frac{3}{2} N k_B T$$

### 3. Connecting to Macroscopic Variables ($P$ and $V$)

This is where the Ideal Gas Law comes in. You likely know it as:

$$PV = N k_B T$$

(Or $PV = nRT$ if you prefer using moles).

By substituting $N k_B T$ with $PV$ in our energy equation, we get the form used in the solution:

$$U = \frac{3}{2} (N k_B T) = \frac{3}{2} PV$$

Why is this useful?

Using $U = \frac{3}{2}PV$ allows you to calculate the energy directly from the pressure and volume values on your $P-V$ diagram without needing to figure out the temperature ($T$) or the number of particles ($N$) first.
