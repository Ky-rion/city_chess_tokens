This is the classic "Nuclear vs. Chemical" showdown! This calculation is one of the most important in physics because it mathematically proves why nuclear energy is so revolutionary (and intimidating).

We are comparing **Chemical Energy** (rearranging electrons, ruled by the electromagnetic force) vs. **Nuclear Energy** (rearranging nucleons, ruled by the Strong Nuclear Force).

Here is the step-by-step breakdown.

### Step 1: Calculate the Energy from 1 gram of Coal

The problem simplifies coal to pure Carbon ($C$) and gives us the specific reaction energy:

$$C + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 4.1 \text{ eV}$$

**1. How many Carbon atoms are in 1 gram?**

-   The molar mass of Carbon is **12 g/mol**.
    
-   Using Avogadro's number ($N_A \approx 6.022 \times 10^{23}$):
    
    $$\text{Number of atoms} = \frac{1 \text{ g}}{12 \text{ g/mol}} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ atoms/mol}$$
    
    $$N_C \approx 5.018 \times 10^{22} \text{ atoms}$$
    

2. Total Energy from burning 1g of Coal ($E_{coal}$)

Multiply the number of atoms by the energy per reaction ($4.1 \text{ eV}$):

$$E_{coal} = (5.018 \times 10^{22}) \times 4.1 \text{ eV}$$

$$E_{coal} \approx 2.06 \times 10^{23} \text{ eV} = \mathbf{2.06 \times 10^{17} \text{ MeV}}$$

_(Note: I converted to MeV by dividing by $10^6$ so we can compare it easily to the Uranium number)._

### Step 2: Recall the Energy from 1 gram of Uranium

From our calculation in Part (a), we found the total energy released by splitting 1 gram of ${}^{235}\text{U}$ was:

$$E_{uranium} \approx \mathbf{4.56 \times 10^{23} \text{ MeV}}$$

---

### Step 3: The Comparison (The "How Much Coal?" Calculation)

We want to find out how many grams of coal ($m_{coal}$) provide the same energy as 1 gram of Uranium. We can set up a simple ratio:

$$\text{Ratio} = \frac{E_{uranium} (\text{per gram})}{E_{coal} (\text{per gram})}$$

$$\text{Ratio} = \frac{4.56 \times 10^{23} \text{ MeV}}{2.06 \times 10^{17} \text{ MeV}}$$

$$\text{Ratio} \approx \mathbf{2,213,592}$$

This number tells us that **Uranium is roughly 2.2 million times more energy-dense than coal.**

To get the equivalent mass:

$$Mass_{coal} = 1 \text{ g (Uranium)} \times 2,213,592$$

$$Mass_{coal} \approx 2,213,592 \text{ g}$$

### Step 4: Convert to Real-World Units

$2.2$ million grams is hard to visualize. Let's convert it to metric tons.

-   $1 \text{ kg} = 1,000 \text{ g}$
    
-   $1 \text{ ton} = 1,000 \text{ kg} = 1,000,000 \text{ g}$
    

$$Mass_{coal} \approx 2.2 \text{ tons}$$

So, **1 gram of Uranium** (a piece the size of a grain of rice) releases as much energy as burning **2.2 metric tons of Coal** (a literal truckload).

_(Note: In my previous estimation, I said "2.5 tons" based on standard rough estimates. Our calculation here was precise based on the numbers you provided, landing on 2.2 tons. This confirms the estimate was very close!)_

### Professor's Final Takeaway: Why such a huge difference?

You might wonder, "Why is the number so big?"

-   **Coal (Chemical Energy):** deals with **Electrons**. The force holding electrons in orbit is the _Electromagnetic force_. The energy scale is in **eV** (electron-volts).
    
-   **Uranium (Nuclear Energy):** deals with **Nucleons** (protons/neutrons). The force holding them together is the _Strong Nuclear Force_. The energy scale is in **MeV** (millions of electron-volts).
    

Because the Strong Force is effectively a million times stronger than the Electromagnetic force at these distances, the energy yield is a million times greater.

**You have now completed the full nuclear physics problem set!** You calculated fission (breaking atoms), fusion (building atoms), and proved why nuclear energy is so incredibly potent compared to fossil fuels.
