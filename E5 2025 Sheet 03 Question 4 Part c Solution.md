Excellent! You are doing great. It is time for the grand finale of this problem.

In the previous part, I hinted that the maximum energy was around **0.42 MeV**. Now, we are going to prove it mathematically.

The question asks for the **maximum energy ($E_{pp, \max}$)** of the neutrino.

### The Physics Logic

To solve this, we use the principle of Conservation of Energy.

The logic is simple: We have an "Energy Budget."

1.  We start with a certain amount of mass (two protons).
    
2.  We turn that into slightly lighter particles (a deuteron and a positron).
    
3.  The **missing mass** becomes available Energy ($Q$).
    
4.  That energy $Q$ is shared as **Kinetic Energy** between the three products: the deuteron, the positron, and the neutrino.
    

$$Q = K_{\text{deuteron}} + K_{\text{positron}} + E_{\text{neutrino}}$$

How do we maximize the Neutrino energy?

To give the neutrino the biggest slice of the energy pie, the other particles must take as little as possible.

1.  **Deuteron Recoil:** The problem explicitly tells us to _"neglect the recoil of heavier particles."_ This means we assume the heavy deuteron ($d$) hardly moves, so $K_{\text{deuteron}} \approx 0$.
    
2.  **Positron Energy:** To leave the maximum amount for the neutrino, we assume the positron is created with **zero kinetic energy** (it is created at rest).
    

Therefore, for the maximum case:

$$E_{\text{neutrino, max}} \approx Q$$

### The Calculation

Let's find $Q$ by calculating the mass difference ($\Delta m$). We will use **Atomic Mass Units (u)**.

1. Identify the Masses

(We need the nuclear masses here, not the atomic masses, because the reaction involves bare nuclei).

-   **Mass of Proton ($m_p$):** $1.007276 \, \text{u}$
    
-   Mass of Deuteron ($m_d$): $2.013553 \, \text{u}$
    
    (Note: If you look up the atomic mass of Deuterium, it is $2.014102$. We subtract the electron mass $0.000549$ to get the nucleus mass).
    
-   **Mass of Positron ($m_e$):** $0.000549 \, \text{u}$
    
-   **Mass of Neutrino:** $0 \, \text{u}$
    

2. Calculate Mass of Reactants (Left Side)

$$Mass_{\text{in}} = 2 \times m_p$$

$$Mass_{\text{in}} = 2 \times 1.007276 \, \text{u}$$

$$Mass_{\text{in}} = 2.014552 \, \text{u}$$

3. Calculate Mass of Products (Right Side)

$$Mass_{\text{out}} = m_d + m_e$$

$$Mass_{\text{out}} = 2.013553 \, \text{u} + 0.000549 \, \text{u}$$

$$Mass_{\text{out}} = 2.014102 \, \text{u}$$

4. Find the Missing Mass ($\Delta m$)

$$\Delta m = Mass_{\text{in}} - Mass_{\text{out}}$$

$$\Delta m = 2.014552 \, \text{u} - 2.014102 \, \text{u}$$

$$\Delta m = 0.000450 \, \text{u}$$

5. Convert to Energy (MeV)

We use the conversion factor $1 \, \text{u} = 931.49 \, \text{MeV}$.

$$E_{pp, \max} = 0.000450 \, \text{u} \times 931.49 \, \text{MeV/u}$$

$$E_{pp, \max} \approx 0.419 \, \text{MeV}$$

### Final Answer

The maximum energy of the neutrinos generated in reaction (1) is approximately **0.42 MeV**.

Professor's Closing Note:

This result is very significant in experimental physics! Because this energy is so low (0.42 MeV), these specific neutrinos are very hard to catch. For a long time, our detectors (like the famous Homestake experiment) could only see high-energy neutrinos, so they missed all of these "pp-neutrinos." This led to the famous "Solar Neutrino Problem," which was only solved when we realized neutrinos can change their "flavor" (neutrino oscillation) as they travel!

You have now calculated one of the most fundamental numbers in solar physics. Well done!
