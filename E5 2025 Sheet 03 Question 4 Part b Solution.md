This is a wonderful follow-up question. In physics exams, "Sketch qualitatively" is code for "Show me you understand the **shape** and the **limits** of the data, even if you don't plot exact numbers."

Here is how we are going to construct this sketch together, step-by-step.

### The Physics: Why is there a spectrum?

Before we draw a single line, we have to ask: **Is the energy fixed, or is it a range?**

-   **2-Body Decay (Fixed):** If a particle decays into just _two_ things (like $A \to B + C$), conservation of momentum forces them to move apart with very specific, exact speeds. The energy graph would look like a single sharp spike (a "line").
    
-   3-Body Decay (Continuous): Look at Reaction (1):
    
    $$p + p \to d + e^+ + \nu_e$$
    
    There are three particles coming out (the deuteron $d$, the positron $e^+$, and the neutrino $\nu_e$). When three people share a pizza, one person might get a huge slice and the others get crumbs, or everyone might share equally.
    

Because the energy can be shared in infinite combinations between the positron and the neutrino, the neutrino can have **any energy** from zero up to a maximum limit. This creates a **continuous spectrum**.

### Step 1: Setting up the Axes

To get full marks on a sketch, you must label your axes.

-   **X-axis:** Label this **$E_\nu$ (Neutrino Energy)**.
    
-   **Y-axis:** Label this **$N(E)$** or **Intensity** or **Probability**. This represents how many neutrinos appear at that specific energy.
    

### Step 2: Drawing the Shape (The "Hill")

Now, for the shape of the neutrino spectrum for Reaction (1).

1.  **Start at Zero:** The curve should start at the origin $(0,0)$. It is possible for the neutrino to emerge with almost zero energy (meaning the positron took it all).
    
2.  **The Rise:** The curve goes up smoothly. It looks somewhat like a bell curve or a "hump."
    
3.  **The Max ($E_{max}$):** The curve must hit the X-axis again at a specific maximum energy.
    
    -   _Professor's Note:_ While you don't need the exact number for a "qualitative" sketch, it helps to know that for this specific $pp$ reaction, the maximum neutrino energy is about **0.42 MeV**. This is actually quite low energy compared to other solar neutrinos!
        

**What to draw:** Draw a smooth "hill" that starts at zero, peaks somewhere in the middle (or slightly to the left), and drops down to touch the X-axis at a point labeled $E_{max}$.

### Step 3: The Comparison with the $\beta$ Spectrum

The question asks you to compare this to the "$\beta$ spectrum."

In physics, the "$\beta$ spectrum" refers to the energy distribution of electrons (or positrons) emitted in standard beta decay (like a neutron turning into a proton).

**The Comparison:**

-   **Similarity:** Both the neutrinos in Reaction (1) and the electrons in a standard $\beta$ spectrum result from **3-body decays**. Therefore, **both are continuous spectra.** They both look like "hills," not sharp spikes.
    
-   **The "Mirror" Effect (The Nuance):** In a decay where energy is shared between a lepton (electron/positron) and a neutrino, their energy spectra are roughly mirror images. If the electron tends to take high energy, the neutrino takes low energy.
    
    -   Generally, the $\beta$ spectrum (for the electron) and the neutrino spectrum look **qualitatively identical**: A continuous curve starting at 0 and ending at a maximum.
        

### Summary Checklist for Your Sketch

To ensure your sketch is "correct" in the eyes of a grader, check these three boxes:

1.  **Continuous Curve:** Make sure you drew a smooth hump, not a sharp vertical line. (A sharp line would be wrong because this is a 3-body process).
    
2.  **Finite Endpoint:** The curve must hit the x-axis at a distinct point labeled $Q$ or $E_{max}$. It shouldn't trail off to infinity.
    
3.  **Labels:** Axes are labeled ($E$ vs $Intensity$).
    

**Professor's Verdict:** If you draw a simple bell-curve shape starting at 0 and ending at $E_{max}$, and write a sentence saying, _"Like the standard $\beta$-spectrum, this is a continuous spectrum because the energy is shared between three particles,"_ you will likely get full credit!

**Ready to try the next part, or would you like to calculate that 0.42 MeV endpoint to be sure?**
