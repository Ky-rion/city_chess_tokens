Hello! That is a truly excellent question. It gets right to the heart of what makes nuclear physics so interesting. It seems like a paradox, doesn't it?

You're thinking: "If tritium is _more strongly bound_, it must be _more stable_ or in a _lower energy state_. Why would it _ever_ decay into something _less_ stable?"

That intuition is very smart, but it's missing one crucial piece of the puzzle. The binding energy ($B$) values given are a bit of a trap if you don't know the full story.

Here is the detailed breakdown.

### 🎯 The Real Rule: Total Mass Must Decrease

In physics, a spontaneous decay (like beta decay) can happen for **one reason and one reason only:**

> **The total mass of the starting particles is GREATER than the total mass of all the final particles.**

Nature _always_ wants to move from a state of higher total mass-energy to a state of lower total mass-energy. The "missing" mass ($\Delta m$) isn't lost—it's converted into pure kinetic energy ($E = \Delta m \cdot c^2$) for the decay products, which fly away.

The binding energy $B$ is part of this mass calculation, but it's not the _only_ thing that matters.

### ⚛️ What _Actually_ Happens in Tritium Beta Decay?

Let's look at the "before" and "after" picture of the nucleus.

1.  **BEFORE (Parent):** We have a **Tritium (³H) nucleus**. It's made of **1 proton and 2 neutrons**.
    
2.  **THE EVENT (β-decay):** Inside the nucleus, one of the **neutrons** spontaneously changes into a **proton**. To conserve charge, this process must also create and eject two new particles: an **electron** ($e^-$) (this is the "beta" particle) and an **electron antineutrino** ($\bar{\nu}_e$).
    
3.  **AFTER (Daughter):** The nucleus now has **2 protons and 1 neutron**. This is, by definition, a **Helium-3 (³He) nucleus**.
    

So, the full reaction is:

$${^3_1}\text{H} \rightarrow {^3_2}\text{He} + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$$

### 💰 The "Energy Budget" of the Decay

Now we can apply our "total mass" rule. The decay can happen _if and only if_:

$\text{Mass}(³\text{H nucleus}) > \text{Mass}(³\text{He nucleus}) + \text{Mass}(e^-)$

(We'll ignore the antineutrino's mass, which is extremely tiny and doesn't affect the 'yes/no' outcome).

Let's figure out why the ³H nucleus is heavier, even though it's "more tightly bound" to its specific parts. This is where the particle masses and binding energies all come together.

Think of it like an energy budget. We are looking for a "profit" of energy (called the **Q-value**). If the Q-value is positive, the decay happens.

1. The Energy "Income" (The big difference!):

The key event is a neutron ($n$) turning into a proton ($p$). Let's look at their masses:

-   **Mass of a neutron ($m_n$):** $\approx 939.565 \text{ MeV}/c^2$
    
-   **Mass of a proton ($m_p$):** $\approx 938.272 \text{ MeV}/c^2$
    

A **neutron is heavier than a proton**! This mass difference is our primary source of "income." By changing a neutron to a proton, the nucleus cashes in on this mass difference.

2. The Energy "Cost" (What you spotted):

You are 100% correct that the nucleus becomes less tightly bound. We are going from a high-binding-energy system to a lower-one. This is an energy "cost" we have to pay.

-   **Binding Energy "Cost"** = $B(³\text{H}) - B(³\text{He})$
    
-   **Cost** = $8.4818 \text{ MeV} - 7.7181 \text{ MeV} = \textbf{0.7637 MeV}$
    

This is the energy we _lose_ from the nuclear arrangement becoming less efficient.

3. The "Profit" (The Q-Value):

The decay can only happen if our "income" (from $n \rightarrow p$) is greater than our "cost" (from the change in binding).

-   **Total Income** (from $n \rightarrow p + e^-$): The energy released from a free neutron decay is $\text{Mass}(n) - \text{Mass}(p) - \text{Mass}(e)$.
    
    -   $(939.565 \text{ MeV}) - (938.272 \text{ MeV}) - (0.511 \text{ MeV}) = \textbf{0.782 MeV}$
        
-   **Total Cost** (from binding): $\textbf{0.7637 MeV}$
    

**Let's do the final calculation:**

$\text{Energy Released (Q-value)} = (\text{Income}) - (\text{Cost})$

$Q = 0.782 \text{ MeV} - 0.7637 \text{ MeV}$

$Q = +0.0183 \text{ MeV} \text{ (or } 18.3 \text{ keV})$

---

### ✅ Conclusion

The final Q-value is **positive**!

This means that even though the nucleus becomes less tightly bound (which _costs_ $0.7637 \text{ MeV}$), the energy we _gain_ by converting a heavy neutron into a lighter proton and electron (which _provides_ $0.782 \text{ MeV}$) is **slightly greater**.

This small "profit" of $0.0183 \text{ MeV}$ is the total energy that gets shared as kinetic energy between the electron and the antineutrino.

So, to answer your question directly:

Why can ³H decay?

Because the total mass of a tritium nucleus is (1) slightly greater than the total mass of a helium-3 nucleus plus an electron (2). This mass difference exists because the energy gained from converting a heavy neutron into a lighter proton is more than the energy lost from the nucleus becoming less tightly bound (3).

Does this "energy budget" analogy help clarify things? We can use this same logic to look at the next part of the question whenever you're ready.
