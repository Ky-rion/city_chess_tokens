Welcome to class! It is a pleasure to meet a curious student. You have picked a fascinating topic: **Solar Neutrinos and Nuclear Fusion**. This is the very engine that powers our Sun and makes life on Earth possible.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step. Don't worry if you haven't seen this before; we will build the solution from the ground up using the most famous equation in physics.

### The Goal

We need to calculate **$Q$**, which represents the **energy released** during the fusion reaction shown in equation (2):

$$4p \to {}^4\text{He}^{++} + 2e^+ + 2\nu_e + Q$$

### The Concept: Where does the energy come from?

In nuclear physics, energy comes from a change in mass. This is Einstein's famous principle of Mass-Energy Equivalence:

$$E = mc^2$$

When four protons fuse to become helium, the final product actually weighs _slightly less_ than the ingredients we started with. That missing mass (called the "mass defect") isn't lost; it is converted directly into pure energy ($Q$).

To find $Q$, we just need to compare the mass of the **Left Side (Reactants)** vs. the mass of the **Right Side (Products)**.

### Step 1: Gather the Constants

To do this calculation, we need the precise masses of the particles involved. In physics, we usually use the **atomic mass unit (u)**.

-   **Mass of a Proton ($m_p$):** $\approx 1.007276 \, \text{u}$
    
-   Mass of a Helium-4 Nucleus ($m_{\text{He-nuc}}$): $\approx 4.001506 \, \text{u}$
    
    (Note: This is the mass of the nucleus only, known as the alpha particle, not the whole atom).
    
-   Mass of a Positron ($m_{e^+}$): $\approx 0.000549 \, \text{u}$
    
    (This is the same mass as an electron).
    
-   Mass of a Neutrino ($\nu_e$): $\approx 0$
    
    (For this calculation, the mass is so incredibly tiny we treat it as zero).
    

### Step 2: Calculate Mass of Reactants (Left Side)

The left side of the equation has 4 protons.

$$Mass_{initial} = 4 \times m_p$$

$$Mass_{initial} = 4 \times 1.007276 \, \text{u}$$

$$Mass_{initial} = 4.029104 \, \text{u}$$

### Step 3: Calculate Mass of Products (Right Side)

The right side has 1 Helium nucleus, 2 positrons, and 2 neutrinos.

$$Mass_{final} = m_{\text{He-nuc}} + 2 \times m_{e^+}$$

$$Mass_{final} = 4.001506 + 2(0.000549)$$

$$Mass_{final} = 4.001506 + 0.001098$$

$$Mass_{final} = 4.002604 \, \text{u}$$

### Step 4: Calculate the Mass Difference ($\Delta m$)

Now we see how much mass "disappeared" during the fusion.

$$\Delta m = Mass_{initial} - Mass_{final}$$

$$\Delta m = 4.029104 \, \text{u} - 4.002604 \, \text{u}$$

$$\Delta m = 0.0265 \, \text{u}$$

### Step 5: Convert Mass to Energy

Now we convert that missing mass into energy. In nuclear physics, a very handy conversion factor derived from $c^2$ is:

$1 \, \text{u} \approx 931.5 \, \text{MeV}$ (Mega Electron-Volts)

$$Q = 0.0265 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u}$$

$$Q \approx 24.68 \, \text{MeV}$$

### Professor's Pro-Tip: The "Hidden" Energy

If you look up the energy of the solar pp-chain in a textbook, you will often see the number **26.73 MeV**. You might wonder, _why did we get 24.7 MeV instead of 26.7 MeV?_

This is a subtle but important detail!

1.  **Our Calculation (24.7 MeV):** We calculated the energy for the equation _exactly as it is written in the image_. We stopped when the positrons ($e^+$) were created.
    
2.  **What happens next (The extra 2 MeV):** In the Sun, those 2 positrons ($e^+$) immediately crash into 2 electrons ($e^-$) floating around in the plasma. They annihilate each other!
    
    -   This annihilation releases the mass-energy of the 2 positrons _and_ the 2 electrons.
        
    -   Total mass of 4 electrons/positrons $\approx 2.044$ MeV.
        
    -   $24.68 \text{ MeV} + 2.04 \text{ MeV} \approx 26.72 \text{ MeV}$.
        

The Final Answer:

Strictly speaking, for the reaction equation (2) exactly as written in your assignment, the energy released is approximately 24.7 MeV.

However, the total energy released by the Sun for every Helium atom created (including the subsequent positron annihilation) is **26.7 MeV**.
