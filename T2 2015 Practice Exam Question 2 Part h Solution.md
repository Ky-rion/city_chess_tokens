This is the final part (h) of the quantum mechanics problem. You are asked to **argue** that the parameter $m := \mu/\hbar$ (the factor for the $\mathbf{\hat{L}}_z$ eigenvalue) must run in integer steps from $-l$ to $l$, and consequently, that $l$ must be an integer or a half-integer.

## 1. Argument for Integer Steps for $m$

We use the properties of the ladder operators $\mathbf{\hat{L}}_{\pm}$ established in part (c) and the boundary conditions established in part (f) and (g).

### A. Eigenvalue Spectrum

We know the $\mathbf{\hat{L}}_z$ eigenvalue of a state $|f\rangle$ is $\mu$. We define the factor $m$:

$$\mathbf{\hat{L}}_z |f\rangle = \mu |f\rangle = m \hbar |f\rangle$$

The operators $\mathbf{\hat{L}}_{\pm}$ transform an eigenvector of $\mathbf{\hat{L}}_z$ into a new eigenvector with a modified eigenvalue:

$$\mathbf{\hat{L}}_z (\mathbf{\hat{L}}_{\pm}|f\rangle) = (\mu \pm \hbar) (\mathbf{\hat{L}}_{\pm}|f\rangle)$$

### B. The Ladder

If we start with the maximum state $|f_t\rangle$ (with eigenvalue $\mu_{\text{max}} = \hbar l$) and repeatedly apply the lowering operator $\mathbf{\hat{L}}_{-}$, we generate a sequence of states with eigenvalues:

$$\mu_{\text{max}}, \quad \mu_{\text{max}} - \hbar, \quad \mu_{\text{max}} - 2\hbar, \quad \dots$$

In terms of the factor $m$:

$$l, \quad l - 1, \quad l - 2, \quad \dots$$

Since this process must stop at the minimum eigenvalue $\mu_{\text{min}} = \hbar \tilde{l} = -\hbar l$ (as shown in part (g)), the sequence of $m$ values must be:

$$l, \quad l-1, \quad l-2, \quad \dots, \quad -l+1, \quad -l$$

This explicitly shows that the parameter $m$ runs in integer steps from the maximum value $l$ down to the minimum value $-l$.

$$m \in \{l, l-1, l-2, \dots, -l+1, -l\}$$

## 2. Argument for $l$ being Integer or Half-Integer

The total number of possible $m$ values in the sequence is determined by the range from $l$ to $-l$. The difference between the highest $m$ value and the lowest $m$ value must be an integer (since the steps are integers):

$$\text{Range} = l - (-l) = 2l$$

Since the sequence is generated by subtracting $\mathbf{1}$ a certain number of times, $2l$ must be a non-negative integer. Let $N$ be the number of steps (which is $N = 2l$):

$$2l = N, \quad \text{where } N \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}$$

Solving for $l$:

$$l = N/2$$

This result means that $l$ can only take on values that are:

-   **Integers** (when $N$ is even, e.g., $l=0, 1, 2, \dots$).
    
-   **Half-integers** (when $N$ is odd, e.g., $l=1/2, 3/2, 5/2, \dots$).
    

Therefore, the magnitude of the angular momentum $l$ must be a **non-negative integer or half-integer**.

This concludes the derivation of the spectrum of angular momentum eigenvalues, one of the most important results in quantum mechanics.
