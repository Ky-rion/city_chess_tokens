## ☢️ Nuclear Physics Cheat Sheet

### 1. Fundamental Constants & Units

These are your conversion tools to switch between the atomic scale and the real world.

### 2. The Semi-Empirical Mass Formula (Fission)

Used for **large nuclei** (like Uranium) where the nucleus behaves like a liquid drop.

The Formula (Binding Energy $B$):

$$B(A, Z) = a_v A - a_s A^{2/3} - a_c \frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}} - a_{sym} \frac{(A-2Z)^2}{A}$$

**The Coefficients:**

-   **Volume ($a_v$):** $15.5 \text{ MeV}$
    
-   **Surface ($a_s$):** $16.8 \text{ MeV}$
    
-   **Coulomb ($a_c$):** $0.72 \text{ MeV}$
    
-   **Symmetry ($a_{sym}$):** $23.0 \text{ MeV}$
    

Reaction Energy ($Q$):

$$Q = \sum B_{products} - \sum B_{reactants}$$

### 3. Exact Mass Calculation (Fusion)

Used for **small nuclei** (like Hydrogen/Helium) where the liquid drop model fails.

The Formula (Mass Defect):

$$Q = [ \text{Mass}_{reactants} - \text{Mass}_{products} ] \times c^2$$

**Calculation Step:**

1.  Sum the atomic masses of the start ($M_{start}$).
    
2.  Sum the atomic masses of the end ($M_{end}$).
    
3.  Find difference $\Delta m$ in atomic mass units ($u$).
    
4.  Convert to Energy: $E = \Delta m \times 931.5 \text{ MeV}$.

### 4. Scaling to the Real World (Per Gram)

How to turn atomic energy into real-world power.

Step 1: Find Atoms per Gram

$$N = \frac{1 \text{ g}}{\text{Molar Mass (g/mol)}} \times N_A$$

Step 2: Total Energy

$$E_{total} = N \times Q_{\text{per reaction}}$$

**Comparison Fact:**

-   **Nuclear Fission Density:** $\sim 1 \text{ g Uranium} \approx 2.2 \text{ metric tons of Coal}$
    
-   **Nuclear Fusion Density:** $\sim 1 \text{ g Fusion Fuel} \approx 4 \times \text{Fission Energy}$

### 🎓 Professor's Final Note

You have done excellent work today! You successfully navigated from the binding forces of the heaviest elements down to the fusion fires of the stars, and finally grounded it all in a real-world engineering context.

If you ever see a news headline about ITER or a nuclear power plant, you can now smile and say, _"I know exactly how they calculated that energy output."_

Class dismissed! Do you have any other questions, or shall we wrap up here?
