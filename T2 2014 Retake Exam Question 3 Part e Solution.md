This is a fantastic question because it forces us to visualize the math we just calculated. In Quantum Mechanics, being able to translate a formula like $\psi_{2,3}$ into a mental image is a superpower.

You are asked to sketch the "locations of minimal and maximal probability" (Orte minimaler und maximaler Aufenthaltswahrscheinlichkeit) for the state **$\psi_{2,3}$**.

Here is how you should think about it and how to construct your sketch step-by-step.

### 1. Understand What We Are Sketching

The "Probability Density" is the square of the wavefunction:

$$P(x,y) = |\psi_{2,3}(x,y)|^2 \propto \sin^2\left(\frac{2 \pi x}{a}\right) \sin^2\left(\frac{3 \pi y}{a}\right)$$

We are looking for two things:

-   **Minima:** Where is the probability **Zero**? (These are called "Nodes").
    
-   **Maxima:** Where is the probability **Highest**? (These are the "Peaks" or "Antinodes").
    

Since the function is separated into $X$ and $Y$ parts, we can analyze the grid lines for each axis separately and then combine them.

### 2. Analyze the X-Direction ($m=2$)

The quantum number $m=2$ controls the pattern in the horizontal direction.

Think of a sine wave that has to fit two full "humps" inside the box.

-   Where is it zero (Minima)?
    
    A sine wave is zero at the start, the end, and exactly in the middle of a full cycle.
    
    -   $x = 0$ (Left wall)
        
    -   $x = a$ (Right wall)
        
    -   **$x = a/2$ (The middle)** $\leftarrow$ This is a vertical nodal line.
        
-   Where is it max (Maxima)?
    
    The peaks happen halfway between the zeros.
    
    -   $x = a/4$ (Center of the left half)
        
    -   $x = 3a/4$ (Center of the right half)
        

**Visual for X:** You have divided the box vertically into **2 columns**.

### 3. Analyze the Y-Direction ($n=3$)

The quantum number $n=3$ controls the pattern in the vertical direction.

Think of a sine wave that fits three full "humps" inside the box.

-   Where is it zero (Minima)?
    
    We need to cut the box into three equal strips. The zeros occur at every $1/3$ of the length.
    
    -   $y = 0$ (Bottom wall)
        
    -   $y = a$ (Top wall)
        
    -   **$y = a/3$ (First line)**
        
    -   **$y = 2a/3$ (Second line)**
        
-   Where is it max (Maxima)?
    
    The peaks happen halfway between these lines.
    
    -   $y = a/6$
        
    -   $y = a/2$ (Dead center vertically)
        
    -   $y = 5a/6$
        

**Visual for Y:** You have divided the box horizontally into **3 rows**.

---

### 4. Constructing the Sketch

Now, combine the 2 columns and 3 rows.

Imagine a Grid:

You are essentially drawing a grid on your square table.

-   Draw a vertical line down the center ($x = a/2$).
    
-   Draw two horizontal lines cutting the height into thirds ($y = a/3$ and $y = 2a/3$).
    

This grid divides your square into **$2 \times 3 = 6$ smaller rectangles**.

**The Minima (Zero Probability):**

-   The particle will **never** be found exactly on the grid lines we just drew. These are the "nodal lines."
    
-   **Sketching tip:** Draw these lines (perhaps as dashed lines) and label them "Probability = 0".
    

**The Maxima (High Probability):**

-   The particle is most likely to be found in the exact center of each of those 6 small rectangles.
    
-   **Sketching tip:** Draw a blob, a circle, or a "+" sign in the center of each of the 6 rectangles. These are the "hot spots."
    

### Summary Checklist for Your Drawing:

1.  **Draw a square** with axes $x$ and $y$ going from $0$ to $a$.
    
2.  **Minima:** Draw the internal walls (nodal lines).
    
    -   One vertical line at $x = 0.5a$.
        
    -   Two horizontal lines at $y = 0.33a$ and $y = 0.67a$.
        
3.  **Maxima:** Mark the centers of the resulting 6 boxes.
    
    -   Coordinates: $(0.25a, 0.17a)$, $(0.75a, 0.17a)$, etc.
        
4.  **Label:** "Minima" pointing to the lines, "Maxima" pointing to the centers of the blobs.
    

It should look like a waffle with 6 squares! The "batter" of the waffle is where the probability is high, and the "grooves" are where the probability is zero.
