This is it! The final stretch. You are absolutely right—this problem is the "cousin" of the previous one. Instead of changing the nucleus ($Z$), we are now changing the particle itself by changing its mass ($m$).

We are solving **Problem 5g**: "How does the extent (radius of maximum probability density) scale with the mass $m$?".

Let's finish this journey with our standard breakdown.

### Question 1: What is the "Extent" of the atom?

The question asks about the "radius of maximum probability density."

Do you remember Problem 5b? We calculated exactly this! We found that the electron likes to hang out at exactly $r = a$ (the Bohr radius or the scaling length).

So, when the question asks how the "extent" scales, it is really asking: **"How does the scaling radius $a_1$ depend on $m$?"**

### Question 2: Where is the formula?

We don't need to derive anything new. We just need to look back at **Problem 5e**, where the problem sheet explicitly defined the scaling length $a_1$.

The formula given was:

$$a_1 = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar^2}{m e^2 Z}$$

### Question 3: How does it depend on mass $m$?

Look at the position of $m$ in that fraction. It is in the **denominator**.

$$a_1 \propto \frac{1}{m}$$

This means the relationship is **inversely proportional**.

### Question 4: What is the physical meaning?

If you increase the mass $m$:

1.  The denominator gets bigger.
    
2.  The radius $a_1$ gets **smaller**.
    

Professor's Intuition:

Imagine replacing the electron with a "Muon" (a particle that is basically a heavy electron, about 200 times more massive).

Since $m$ is 200 times larger, the radius $a_1$ becomes 200 times smaller. The atom shrinks!

Why? In quantum mechanics, a heavier particle has a shorter wavelength ($\lambda = h/p$). Because it is "less wave-like" and "more heavy," it falls deeper into the potential well and orbits much closer to the nucleus.

### Final Answer for (5g)

The extent of the wave function (the radius of maximum probability density) scales **inversely with the mass**:

$$\text{Radius} \propto \frac{1}{m}$$
