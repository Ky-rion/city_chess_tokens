We are back for round two! This part of the question takes us from the heavy, splitting atoms of fission (like Uranium) to the light, fusing atoms of the stars.

The **ITER project** (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is essentially an attempt to build a small star on Earth to generate clean energy. It is currently being built in southern France and is one of the most complex engineering projects in human history.

Here is the breakdown for part (b).

### Part 1: The Reaction Used at ITER

While stars (like our Sun) mostly fuse Hydrogen-1 (protons), that process is actually too slow for a power plant on Earth. Instead, ITER uses a reaction between two "heavy" isotopes of hydrogen: **Deuterium** ($^{2}\text{H}$) and **Tritium** ($^{3}\text{H}$).

The reaction is:

$${}^{2}_{1}\text{H} + {}^{3}_{1}\text{H} \rightarrow {}^{4}_{2}\text{He} + {}^{1}_{0}\text{n}$$

-   **Reactants:** Deuterium ($d$) and Tritium ($t$)
    
-   **Products:** Helium-4 ($\alpha$-particle) and a generic Neutron ($n$)

### Part 2: Why NOT use the Bethe-Weizsäcker Formula?

You asked a great question: _Why can't we just use the formula from part (a)?_

The Bethe-Weizsäcker formula relies on the **"Liquid Drop Model."** It treats the nucleus like a drop of fluid containing many molecules (nucleons).

-   **It works well for large nuclei** (like Uranium with 235 nucleons) where the statistical averaging of forces works out smoothly.
    
-   **It fails for tiny nuclei** (like Deuterium with only 2 nucleons or Helium with 4).
    

In these tiny nuclei, there aren't enough particles to form a "bulk" liquid. The specific quantum mechanical interactions between individual protons and neutrons (such as "shell effects") dominate completely. Using the liquid drop formula here would give you a wildly incorrect answer because the "surface" of the drop is basically the entire nucleus!

### Part 3: Calculating Energy Released (The Q-Value)

Since we can't use the approximation formula, we use the exact **tabulated atomic masses**. This is the standard "accounting" method in nuclear physics:

$$E = \Delta m c^2$$

We calculate the **mass defect** ($\Delta m$): the difference between what we started with and what we ended up with.

**1. Tabulated Masses (in atomic mass units, u)**

-   Deuterium ($^2_1\text{H}$): $2.014102 \text{ u}$
    
-   Tritium ($^3_1\text{H}$): $3.016049 \text{ u}$
    
-   Helium-4 ($^4_2\text{He}$): $4.002603 \text{ u}$
    
-   Neutron ($^1_0\text{n}$): $1.008665 \text{ u}$
    

2. Calculate Mass of Reactants (Start)

$$Mass_{start} = m({}^2\text{H}) + m({}^3\text{H})$$

$$Mass_{start} = 2.014102 + 3.016049 = \mathbf{5.030151 \text{ u}}$$

3. Calculate Mass of Products (End)

$$Mass_{end} = m({}^4\text{He}) + m({}^1\text{n})$$

$$Mass_{end} = 4.002603 + 1.008665 = \mathbf{5.011268 \text{ u}}$$

4. Find the Mass Defect

$$\Delta m = Mass_{start} - Mass_{end}$$

$$\Delta m = 5.030151 - 5.011268 = \mathbf{0.018883 \text{ u}}$$

5. Convert to Energy (MeV)

We use the standard conversion factor: $1 \text{ u} = 931.5 \text{ MeV/c}^2$.

$$Q = 0.018883 \times 931.5 \approx \mathbf{17.6 \text{ MeV}}$$

So, one single fusion reaction releases roughly **17.6 MeV** of energy.

### Part 4: Energy from 1g of Fuel

This is where fusion really shines. Let's see how much energy we get from 1 gram of the starting mixture.

1. Determine the Molar Mass of the Fuel

The reaction consumes 1 mole of Deuterium and 1 mole of Tritium simultaneously.

-   Mass of 1 mole of D $\approx 2.014 \text{ g}$
    
-   Mass of 1 mole of T $\approx 3.016 \text{ g}$
    
-   **Mass of 1 mole of "Fuel Mix"** $= 2.014 + 3.016 \approx \mathbf{5.03 \text{ g/mol}}$
    

This means that **5.03 grams** of fuel contains Avogadro's number ($N_A \approx 6.022 \times 10^{23}$) of reaction pairs.

2. How many reactions in 1 gram?

If 5.03 g contains $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ reactions, then 1 g contains:

$$N_{reactions} = \frac{6.022 \times 10^{23}}{5.03} \approx 1.197 \times 10^{23} \text{ reactions}$$

3. Total Energy

Multiply the number of reactions by the energy per reaction (17.6 MeV):

$$E_{total} = (1.197 \times 10^{23}) \times 17.6 \text{ MeV} \approx 2.11 \times 10^{24} \text{ MeV}$$

4. Convert to Joules

$$E_{Joules} = (2.11 \times 10^{24}) \times (1.602 \times 10^{-13}) \approx \mathbf{3.38 \times 10^{11} \text{ Joules}}$$

### Summary and Comparison

-   **Energy from 1g Fusion (D-T):** $\approx 3.4 \times 10^{11} \text{ J}$
    
-   **Energy from 1g Fission (U-235):** $\approx 0.7 \times 10^{11} \text{ J}$ (from part a)
    

Professor's Comment:

Notice that Fusion releases roughly 4 to 5 times more energy per gram than Fission! This is why fusion is the "holy grail" of energy research. It uses abundant fuel (hydrogen isotopes) and releases massive energy without the long-lived high-level radioactive waste of fission.
