Here is your essential Thermodynamics Cheat Sheet based on the problem we just solved. This covers the toolkit you need for ideal gas problems.

### **1. The Golden Rules (General)**

-   First Law of Thermodynamics:
    
    $$dU = \delta Q + \delta W$$
    
    -   $\Delta U$: Change in Internal Energy (State function - depends only on start/end).
        
    -   $Q$: Heat added **to** the gas.
        
    -   $W$: Work done **on** the gas.
        
-   Work Formula (Mechanical):
    
    $$W = -\int P \, dV$$
    
    -   **Expansion ($dV > 0$):** $W$ is negative (Gas does work).
        
    -   **Compression ($dV < 0$):** $W$ is positive (Work done on gas).
        
    -   **Area:** Magnitude of Work is the area under the curve in a P-V diagram.
        
-   Ideal Gas Law:
    
    $$PV = N k_B T \quad \text{or} \quad PV = nRT$$

### **2. Monatomic Ideal Gas Specifics**

-   Internal Energy ($U$):
    
    $$U = \frac{3}{2} PV = \frac{3}{2} N k_B T$$
    
    (Valid for Monatomic gases like He, Ne, Ar where degrees of freedom $f=3$)
    
-   Adiabatic Index ($\gamma$):
    
    $$\gamma = \frac{f+2}{f} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67$$

### **3. Process Types & Formulas**

-   Adiabatic Relationship (Quasistatic):
    
    $$P V^\gamma = \text{constant}$$
    
    (Or $T V^{\gamma-1} = \text{const}$)
    

---

### **4. Entropy & Irreversibility (The Rotor)**

-   Rotor Work (Mechanical Input):
    
    $$dE = M \, d\theta = M \omega \, dt$$
    
    -   In an insulated, fixed-volume container, this work goes entirely into Internal Energy ($U$).
        
-   **Why is it Irreversible?**
    
    -   **Work $\to$ Heat:** Easy (Friction/Stirring). Increases Entropy.
        
    -   **Heat $\to$ Work:** Impossible to do _spontaneously_ or by simply reversing the motion. You cannot "un-stir" a gas to cool it down.
        
    -   **Second Law:** Converting random thermal motion (Heat) back into organized mechanical motion (Work) requires a heat engine and exhaust; it cannot happen perfectly inside a closed box.

Now that you have the tools, would you like me to give you a short practice quiz (just one or two questions) to test if you can apply these formulas on your own?
