This is the final piece of the puzzle! We are now moving from "How do the numbers work?" to "What does this mean for humanity?"

This part asks us to compare **Coal (Chemical)**, **Fission (Current Nuclear)**, and **Fusion (Future Nuclear)**.

Here is the comparative breakdown based on the four factors your question asked for.

### 1. Relative Energy Gain (Per Unit of Fuel)

We actually calculated this in the previous parts, so we can put precise numbers here!

-   **Coal:** **Low.** Chemical reactions release energy in the **eV** range (~4 eV per reaction). You need massive physical quantities (train cars) to generate significant power.
    
-   **Fission:** **Very High.** Releases energy in the **MeV** range (~200 MeV per reaction). As we calculated, 1g of Uranium $\approx$ 2.2 tons of Coal.
    
-   **Fusion:** **Extremely High.** Releases ~17.6 MeV per reaction, but because the fuel atoms (Hydrogen) are so light, you get more atoms per gram.
    
    -   1g of Fusion fuel releases roughly **4 times more energy** than 1g of Fission fuel.
        
    -   1g of Fusion fuel $\approx$ **~8-10 tons of Coal**.
        

**Winner:** **Fusion** (by a landslide).

### 2. Availability of Starting Materials

-   **Coal:** **Abundant but Finite.** We have large reserves (enough for ~100+ years), but mining it causes significant environmental destruction, and once it is gone, it is gone.
    
-   **Fission:** **Moderate.** Uranium-235 is relatively rare (0.7% of natural uranium). We have enough for decades/centuries, but it requires complex mining and enrichment.
    
-   **Fusion:** **Virtually Unlimited.**
    
    -   **Deuterium:** Found in water. Every 1 out of 6,500 Hydrogen atoms in the ocean is Deuterium. We will effectively never run out.
        
    -   **Tritium:** Does not exist in nature, but is "bred" inside the reactor using **Lithium**. Lithium is abundant in the Earth's crust and oceans.
        

**Winner:** **Fusion**.

### 3. Controllability (Safety)

-   **Coal:** **Easy.** To stop the reaction, you just stop throwing coal into the furnace. It is very chemically stable.
    
-   **Fission:** **Difficult (Chain Reaction).** Fission relies on a self-sustaining "chain reaction." Even after you shut the reactor down, the fuel stays hot for a long time due to "decay heat."
    
    -   _Risk:_ If cooling fails, the core can melt (e.g., Fukushima, Chernobyl).
        
-   **Fusion:** **Difficult (In a safe way).** Fusion is **not** a chain reaction. It requires precise temperature and magnetic confinement to keep going.
    
    -   _Advantage:_ If anything goes wrong (e.g., a magnet fails), the plasma cools down instantly and the reaction just... stops. There is **zero risk of meltdown** because the reaction is incredibly hard to keep going in the first place.
        

**Winner:** **Fusion** (for safety) / **Coal** (for operational simplicity).

### 4. Harmfulness of End Products (Waste)

-   **Coal:** **High (Atmospheric).**
    
    -   Produces massive amounts of $\text{CO}_2$ (climate change).
        
    -   Releases particulates, sulfur dioxide (acid rain), and even trace radioactive elements (uranium/thorium) into the air.
        
-   **Fission:** **High (Solid Waste).**
    
    -   Produces "High-Level Waste" (fission products + transuranic elements) that remain radioactive for **thousands of years**.
        
    -   Requires deep geological storage facilities which are politically and technically difficult to build.
        
-   **Fusion:** **Low.**
    
    -   The main product is **Helium**, which is harmless (and useful for balloons!).
        
    -   _Note:_ The walls of the reactor do become radioactive (neutron activation), but this waste is short-lived (~100 years) compared to fission waste (10,000+ years).
        

**Winner:** **Fusion**.

### Professor's Concluding Thought

"If Fusion is so great, why don't we use it?"

As you saw in part (d), Fusion wins in almost every category: unlimited fuel, no meltdown risk, no high-level waste. The catch is the engineering challenge. We are trying to build a star in a bottle. It requires temperatures of 150 million degrees Celsius, which is harder to achieve than anything else we have ever done.

But, as your calculations showed, the reward—energy that is millions of times denser than coal—is worth the effort.

You have now completed the full analysis! From the math of the atomic nucleus to the global energy strategy of the future. **Great job today!**
