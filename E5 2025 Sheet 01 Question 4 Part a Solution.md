Hello! I'm happy to help you dive into the fascinating world of **Rutherford (Geiger-Marsden) Scattering**! This experiment was a true landmark in physics, completely changing our understanding of the atom.

The question you're asking relates to the closest approach of the $\alpha$ particle to the gold nucleus, which happens during a head-on collision.

## 🧐 Conceptual Overview: The Closest Approach

First, let's establish the context:

1.  **The Setup:** The experiment involves firing **positively charged $\alpha$ particles** (which are helium nuclei, ${}^4\text{He}^{2+}$) at a thin foil of gold.
    
2.  **The Interaction:** As an $\alpha$ particle approaches the much heavier, also **positively charged gold nucleus**, the **electrostatic repulsive force (Coulomb force)** between them slows the $\alpha$ particle down and eventually pushes it away.
    
3.  Conservation of Energy: Because the gold nucleus is so much heavier (around 50 times the mass of the $\alpha$ particle), we can assume it remains practically stationary. The total energy of the $\alpha$ particle is conserved throughout the process. The total energy is the sum of its kinetic energy ($E_k$) and its potential energy ($E_p$).
    
    $$E_{\text{total}} = E_k + E_p = \text{constant}$$

## 🎯 Part 1: Scattering Angles for Smallest Distance

The question asks: **"At which scattering angles do the nuclei reach the smallest possible distance?"**

The "smallest possible distance" is the **closest distance of approach ($r_{\min}$)** between the $\alpha$ particle and the gold nucleus. This minimum distance occurs when the $\alpha$ particle's trajectory is such that it heads directly toward the nucleus.

-   **Head-on Collision:** The smallest distance occurs in a **head-on collision**, where the initial path of the $\alpha$ particle is aimed _directly_ at the center of the gold nucleus.
    
-   **Momentum Reversal:** In this scenario, the $\alpha$ particle slows down completely, stops momentarily at $r_{\min}$ (the **turning point**), and then is repelled straight back along the path it came from.
    
-   **Scattering Angle ($\theta$):** The scattering angle is defined as the angle between the initial direction and the final direction of the $\alpha$ particle. If the particle is deflected straight back, the angle is $\mathbf{180^\circ}$.
    

### **Answer for Scattering Angle:**

The nuclei reach the smallest possible distance when the $\alpha$ particle undergoes a **$180^\circ$ scattering angle** (or $\pi$ radians).

## 💥 Part 2: Kinetic Energy at the Turning Point

The question asks: **"How large is the kinetic energy of the $\alpha$ particles at the turning point?"**

The **turning point** is the location where the $\alpha$ particle reaches the **closest distance of approach ($r_{\min}$) to the gold nucleus.**

-   **Key Insight:** At the turning point, the $\alpha$ particle has completely stopped moving momentarily _before_ being accelerated backward by the electrostatic repulsion.
    
-   **Definition of Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, given by $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$.
    
-   **Velocity at Turning Point:** Since the particle has stopped, its velocity ($v$) is **zero** at the turning point.
    

### **Answer for Kinetic Energy:**

At the turning point, the velocity of the $\alpha$ particle is $v=0$. Therefore, its **kinetic energy ($E_k$) is zero**.

$$E_{k, \text{turning point}} = \frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}v^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}(0)^2 = \mathbf{0}$$

## 💡 Bonus: What happens to the energy? (Deriving $r_{\min}$)

If the kinetic energy is zero, where did the particle's initial $5\text{ MeV}$ of kinetic energy go?

It was all converted into **electric potential energy ($E_p$)**!

1.  **Initial State (Far Away):**
    
    -   Kinetic Energy: $E_{k, \text{initial}} = 5\text{ MeV}$
        
    -   Potential Energy: $E_{p, \text{initial}} \approx 0$ (since the distance is very large)
        
    -   Total Energy: $E_{\text{total}} = E_{k, \text{initial}} + 0 = 5\text{ MeV}$
        
2.  **Final State (Turning Point, $r_{\min}$):**
    
    -   Kinetic Energy: $E_{k, \text{final}} = 0$
        
    -   Potential Energy: $E_{p, \text{final}} = \text{Maximum Potential Energy}$
        
    -   Total Energy: $E_{\text{total}} = 0 + E_{p, \text{final}}$
        
3.  Conservation of Energy:
    
    $$E_{k, \text{initial}} = E_{p, \text{final}}$$
    

The potential energy between two point charges, $Q_1$ (the $\alpha$ particle) and $Q_2$ (the gold nucleus), separated by a distance $r_{\min}$, is given by Coulomb's law:

$$E_{p, \text{final}} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r_{\min}}$$

Here, $Q_1 = +2e$ (for the $\alpha$ particle) and $Q_2 = +Ze$ (for the gold nucleus, where $Z=79$ is the atomic number).

Therefore, we can calculate the closest approach distance, $r_{\min}$:

$$E_{k, \text{initial}} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{(2e)(Ze)}{r_{\min}}$$

$$\mathbf{r_{\min}} = \mathbf{\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{2Ze^2}{E_{k, \text{initial}}}}$$

Rutherford used this calculation to estimate the tiny size of the gold nucleus, which was an astonishing discovery!
