Welcome to the grand finale! We have done all the hard work (drawing the map, deriving the formulas, calculating the state energies). Now, for **Part 1.e**, we simply harvest the results.

This question asks us to calculate the **Work ($W$)** and **Heat ($Q$)** for three specific legs of our journey: **A $\to$ D**, **D $\to$ B**, and **C $\to$ A**.

We will use the First Law of Thermodynamics as our master key:

$$Q = \Delta U - W$$

(Heat added = Change in Internal Energy - Work done on gas)

We will also use the internal energy values ($U$) we just calculated in part (1.d):

-   **$U_A = 0$ J**
    
-   **$U_B = -112.5$ J**
    
-   **$U_C = -145.31$ J**
    
-   **$U_D = +1050$ J**

### 1. Process A $\to$ D (Isobaric Expansion)

-   **The Movement:** The gas expands horizontally from A to D at constant high pressure.
    
-   Step 1: Calculate $\Delta U$
    
    $$\Delta U_{AD} = U_D - U_A = 1050 - 0 = \mathbf{1050 \text{ J}}$$
    
-   Step 2: Calculate Work ($W$)
    
    Since pressure is constant ($10^5$ Pa) and volume expands (by $7 \times 10^{-3}$ m$^3$), work is done by the gas.
    
    $$W_{AD} = -P \Delta V = -(10^5 \text{ Pa})(7 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^3) = \mathbf{-700 \text{ J}}$$
    
-   Step 3: Calculate Heat ($Q$)
    
    $$Q_{AD} = \Delta U_{AD} - W_{AD} = 1050 - (-700) = 1050 + 700 = \mathbf{+1750 \text{ J}}$$
    
    Interpretation: To make the gas expand and get hotter (reach state D), you had to pump in a massive amount of heat ($1750$ J). Some of that energy ($700$ J) was used to push the piston, and the rest ($1050$ J) stayed inside to raise the temperature.
    

### 2. Process D $\to$ B (Isochoric Cooling)

-   **The Movement:** The gas drops vertically from D to B. Volume is locked.
    
-   Step 1: Calculate $\Delta U$
    
    $$\Delta U_{DB} = U_B - U_D = -112.5 - 1050 = \mathbf{-1162.5 \text{ J}}$$
    
-   Step 2: Calculate Work ($W$)
    
    This is an isochoric process (constant volume). The piston does not move.
    
    $$W_{DB} = \mathbf{0 \text{ J}}$$
    
-   Step 3: Calculate Heat ($Q$)
    
    $$Q_{DB} = \Delta U_{DB} - W_{DB} = -1162.5 - 0 = \mathbf{-1162.5 \text{ J}}$$
    
    Interpretation: You locked the piston and cooled the gas drastically, removing $1162.5$ J of heat energy.
    

### 3. Process C $\to$ A (Isochoric Heating)

-   **The Movement:** The gas moves vertically up from C back to A.
    
-   Step 1: Calculate $\Delta U$
    
    $$\Delta U_{CA} = U_A - U_C = 0 - (-145.31) = \mathbf{+145.31 \text{ J}}$$
    
-   Step 2: Calculate Work ($W$)
    
    Again, this is isochoric (vertical line). No piston movement.
    
    $$W_{CA} = \mathbf{0 \text{ J}}$$
    
-   Step 3: Calculate Heat ($Q$)
    
    $$Q_{CA} = \Delta U_{CA} - W_{CA} = 145.31 - 0 = \mathbf{+145.31 \text{ J}}$$
    
    Interpretation: To get back to the starting point A from the cold state C, you simply heated the gas up at constant volume.
